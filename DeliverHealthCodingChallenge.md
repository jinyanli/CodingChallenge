# Deliver Health Coding Challenge

For this challenge, we would like you to pull some data from The One API, manipulate it, and output the final results. You may use any non-Microsoft language to write the code and the code should run on a Linux machine for our team to see the results.

### COMMAND 1:

Use the book API to collect the chapter names from all of the books and output them in chronological order.

### COMMAND 2:

Allow someone to pass a search string into your command to search for a chapter by name. Allow for partial matches for this search.

### COMMAND 3:

Create a quote guessing game. Create a dynamic quiz of 5 questions where a quote is output and multiple choice answers are listed. Then prompt the user to input a guess for the character who said the quote. Once all questions have been answered, output a score for the user.

This quiz should be using the API and shouldnâ€™t repeat the same quote/options every time.
